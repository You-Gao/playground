# playground
as said above, playground for apps and ideas i have

why the flask app? it was deployed on heroku and i wanted it to act as a server for n-react apps.

### Learning Notes
* Remember to clean-up your component **always**
* React is powerful because it manages hooks and states which are bundled into components
* Use UseRef for more traditional variables, UseState for react
* Shared data can be defined in a parent class
* The async nature of .js can really mess you up if you don't understand it clearly

### Todo for Mood
1. Clean-up Code
2. Make Sync Less Janky
3. API Token
4. Mobile Formatting
